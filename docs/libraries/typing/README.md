# Typing Module

The **Typing** module forms the basis of the ITL library for type manipulation. It provides fundamental types and abstractions for flow control, as well as advanced metaprogramming tools, all of which are designed to be independent and optimised.

### Libraries

| Name            | Description                                                                                  | Implemented | Docs                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| itl::base_types | These are the fundamental types that form the basis for building other types and structures. | No          | [base_types documentation](./base_types/README.md) |
| itl::ctypes     | Data types for interoperability with low-level systems and external programming languages.   | No          | [ctypes documentation](./ctypes/README.md)         |
| itl::either     | It represents one of two possible values.                                                    | No          | [either documentation](./either/README.md)         |
| itl::option     | It represents an optional value, enabling the absence of a value to be explicitly indicated. | No          | [option documentation](./option/README.md)         |
| itl::result     | It represents the outcome of an operation, which may be a value or an error.                 | No          | [result documentation](./result/README.md)         |
| itl::meta       | These are tools for metaprogramming, which allow you to manipulate and analyse types.        | No          | [meta documentation](./meta/README.md)             |
| itl::traits     | These are sets of properties and characteristics that are used for advanced metaprogramming. | No          | [traits documentation](./traits/README.md)         |
| itl::variant    | It represents a value that can be one of several possible types.                             | No          | [variant documentation](./variant/README.md)       |
